# GitHub Deployment Fix

## Issues Fixed:
1. **Missing dist folder** - Build process now creates client/dist correctly
2. **Permission denied** - Added proper GitHub Actions permissions
3. **GitHub Actions workflow** - Updated with correct permissions and concurrency

## Updated Workflow Features:
- ✅ Proper permissions for Pages deployment
- ✅ Concurrency control to prevent conflicts  
- ✅ Build output verified working
- ✅ All image import errors resolved

## Deployment Steps:
1. Upload zip contents to GitHub repository
2. Go to Settings → Pages
3. Source: "GitHub Actions"
4. Push to main branch - deployment will trigger automatically
5. Site will be available at: https://username.github.io/repo-name

## Build Verification:
```
✓ 1843 modules transformed.
✓ built in 9.11s
client/dist/index.html created successfully
```

Ready for GitHub Pages deployment!
