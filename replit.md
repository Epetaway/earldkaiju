- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system using shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management and caching
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form processing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

## Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for the API server
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (using Neon serverless driver)
- **Session Storage**: In-memory storage for development, with PostgreSQL session store capability
