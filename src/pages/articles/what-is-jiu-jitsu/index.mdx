# What is Jiu-jitsu
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art that originated in Brazil in the early 20th century. The art was developed by the Gracie family, who were known for their mastery of Japanese Jiu-Jitsu. The Gracies adapted the traditional art to suit their own style and preferences, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu was born.

BJJ is a grappling-based martial art that emphasizes technique, leverage, and submissions. Unlike other martial arts that rely on striking, BJJ focuses on ground fighting and submissions, making it an effective self-defense system for individuals of all sizes and strengths.

One of the unique features of BJJ is that it is often referred to as the "gentle art." This term reflects the non-aggressive, non-violent nature of the art, as well as the emphasis on technique and leverage over brute strength. The philosophy behind the gentle art is that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themselves against a larger, stronger attacker by using proper technique and leverage.

In my opinion, the gentle art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is not just about physical self-defense. It's also about defending, strengthening, and protecting your personal boundaries. By training in BJJ, you learn to be accountable for your actions and to respect the boundaries of others. You also learn to assert your own boundaries and to protect your own peace.

BJJ is a sport that requires a balance of respect and selfishness. On one hand, you must respect your training partners and opponents, treating them with dignity and kindness. On the other hand, you must be selfish enough to protect your own personal boundaries and physical safety.

In BJJ, there is a collision of personal boundaries as practitioners grapple and struggle for control. However, this collision is not about aggression or violence. Instead, it is about mutual respect and the pursuit of excellence. By learning to navigate this collision with respect and accountability, BJJ practitioners develop not only physical strength and skill, but also mental and emotional fortitude.

In conclusion, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a fascinating martial art that emphasizes technique, leverage, and the gentle art of self-defense. It is a sport that requires accountability and respect, as well as a balance of selfishness and selflessness. By practicing BJJ, individuals can not only protect themselves physically, but also develop a deeper sense of personal strength and peace.
